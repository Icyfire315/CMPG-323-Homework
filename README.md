# Budding Florist CMPG 323 Homework
* **Language:** C#
* **GUI/IDE:** Visual Basic

This code/program was my final CREATIVE_I_DO assignment for the CMPG 122. I created this code to allow anyone to order flowers from a florist, they can either have the flowers delivered to them or they can pick it up.They can also decide to either pay my credit card or EFT. It retrospect it is just another program that can be used in a database to store customer's orders that they will either pick up or have it delivered to them. You may ask why this code/program, the reason is that it gave a bit more confidence in my programming skill, I like to be able to see what I am trying to achieve for example, creating a program to help people book for blood donation by giving the relevant information such as weight, age, height, blood type or to help them understand which blood types can be receive and/or donate blood to other types, provided they know their blood type. Plus I like front-end development of programs it allows creativity.

## What does it solve?
Nothing really, it just a code to capture users' input from a text bot and combo box, add them to a list to be either read, write or append. Like i said nothing special about it.

## How to use the program
I will now explain how to use the program. It is pretty straight forward, but it would not be a README if I did not explain how this code/program works.

* When a person makes an order all they have to do is input the relative information, in the text box and combo box, then click on the add button. Once they click on the add button, the order they wanted will be added to a list, similar to add to cart. Once they have ordered what they have wanted the click on the write button to save their order to a list.

* The remove button is used to remove an item from the list, if a user wants to remove a order all they have to do is to select the item theu wish to remove then click on the remove button and the order will be deleted from the list. 

* The clear button is used to clear the input from the combo box and text box, and the clear all button clears both the user's input and the list.

* If they want to see the list they can click on the read button, that opens the file dialog box, then select the list they wish to see. The user can also append to the list by added a new project then they click on the append button that adds a new order to the list. 

* The display button displays the order such as the order number, flower number, flower name, quantity, price, VAT, total, and payment method in child form. 

### What can be done to improve the code
I can use sql database to store the orders of the customers, display all the order information that the customer ordered in a list rather than using labls, I could also use pictures to display what kind of flowers are being sold, and I can set the price of the flowers rather than asking the user for the price.
